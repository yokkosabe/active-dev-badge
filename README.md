Copy the link and add the bot to a pre-created server; the community must also be enabled on the server:

Save the changes and reload the bot token, copy it and paste it into the code. You must have python installed, as well as the disnake library

To install disnake, write this command to the console: py -3 -m pip install -U disnake

We run the code, wait for the bot to connect to the network and enter the command /test into the chat several times. After at least 24 hours, go to the website https://discord.com/developers/active-developer, select your bot, the server on which it is active and receive an icon to your account.
